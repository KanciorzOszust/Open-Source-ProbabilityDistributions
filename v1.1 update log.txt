What's new:
* added Bernoulli.PGF(double z)
* added argument limitation at BetaBinominal.PMF(int x)
* added BetaBinomial.MGF(double t)
* added BetaBinomial.PGF(double z)
* added BetaBinomial.CDF(int x)
* added argument limitation at DiscreteUniform.CDF(int k)
* added Hypergeometric.CDF(int k)
* added parameterHarmonicNumber(int n, double x, double m) in MathLibrary
* added ZipfMandelbrot at Discrete distributions -> With finite support

Bug fixed:
* repaired MathLibrary.hypergeometric(double a, double b, double c, double z);
